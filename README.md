# random-civilization
A simple MVC exercise with Java swing-library. 

This program helps me to decide a civilization to play in the Sid Meier's Civilization IV Beyond the Sword mod called Realism Invictus.

The program retrieves a list of civilizations from a small xml-file, picks one civilization randomly and displays its title on a user interface made with swing-library components.

Every files related to the program are in the SimpleMVC-folder.
